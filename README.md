TODO:
- ~~psrng (LFSR)~~
- maze generation - so many bugs ):
- ~~sprite design~~
- audio
- ~~collision detection~~

  **a32_collision_test.asm:** Basic idea is done but could (possibly) use some refactoring.
  
- title screen
- end game screen
- score
- ~~timer~~

  **a34_end_game_condition.asm:** I think this is mostly done. Sprite code + timer code together along with the game ending (i.e. player is unable to move and timer stops) when time runs out. 


Maybes
- text box (e.g. 'You here some rustling')
- add slenderman
